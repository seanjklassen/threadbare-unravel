## What Is Unravel?

It's a reverb. Not a delay. We checked.

It records the last 750 milliseconds of your performance. Then it plays it back as tiny grains. These grains feed into the reverb. The reverb remembers itself remembering you.

Sometimes the grains play backwards. Sometimes they shimmer. Sometimes they just fall apart.

It's not trying to be a "do-everything" reverb. It does one thing. It does it weirdly.

## The Puck

Most reverb plugins have a ton of knobs that look like hardware from 50 years ago. This one has a puck. Slide it around.

**Left to right:** Body to Air. More presence or more wash. Your call.

**Down to up:** Near to Distant. Subtle or ghostly. Memories from recent or far back.

That's it. 

Advanced controls are in a drawer. Most people never open it.

The puck controls decay, modulation, ghost amount, and spatial depth. We're not sure how. But it works.

## Features

### Ghost Engine
It records you. Then plays you back. Detuned. Sometimes backwards. It's the main thing.

At high settings, memories play in reverse. It sounds surreal. We're not sure why you'd want that. But you can.

### Freeze
Locks the tail. Infinite sustain. The ghost engine freezes too. It replays the same moments over and over. With variation. Same material, different lenses.

Good for pads. Or drones. Or when you want to confuse yourself.

### Ducking
Keeps reverb quiet when you play. Loud when you stop. Simple.

Essential for rhythm. Or when you don't want mud. Most people forget it exists.

### Drift
Modulation. Gentle. Persistent. Breaks up the static stuff.

The puck controls it. Left is stable. Right is seasick. We know which one you'll use.

### True Stereo
8×8 FDN. Real stereo. Not fake stereo. We're proud of this one.

It costs CPU. But it sounds good.

## Who It's For

Shoegaze guitarists. Ambient producers. Indie vocalists. People who like weird reverbs.

It's not for everyone. That's fine. We made it for us. You can use it too.

## Presets

Twelve of them. We named them after feelings. Not parameters. We think that's clever.

1. **unravel** — Default. Works on most things.
2. **fading polaroid** — Intimate. Close. Strong body.
3. **dissolving into mist** — Weightless. Maximum diffusion.
4. **rewind the moment** — Heavy ghost. Reverse playback. Weird.
5. **echoes you can't quite place** — Distant memories. Ethereal.
6. **held breath** — Freeze-ready. Long decay.
7. **sunfaded memory** — Soft. Warm. Nostalgic.
8. **shimmer and sway** — Modulated. Breathing. Evolving.
9. **between the notes** — Heavy ducking. Gaps only.
10. **weightless ascent** — Maximum distance. Hovering.
11. **twilight reversal** — Memories backwards. Surreal.
12. **whispering distance** — Vocals. Clear. Soft.

They're presets. Use them. Or don't. We don't care.

## Specs

VST3. AU. macOS. Windows.

Works at normal sample rates. Probably works at weird ones too. We didn't test everything.

CPU usage is reasonable. Unless you max everything. Then it's not.

---

## Philosophy

We wanted it to feel like a memory. Not a room or a tank or a spring.

Nostalgic. Bittersweet. Weightless. Soft.

That's the goal. We hit it sometimes. Sometimes we don't. That's fine.

It's not trying to do everything. It does one thing. We think it does it well.
