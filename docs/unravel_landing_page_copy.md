## What Is Unravel?

It's a reverb. Not a delay. We checked.

It records the last 750 milliseconds of your performance. Then it plays it back as tiny grains. These grains feed into the reverb. The reverb remembers itself remembering you.

Sometimes the grains play backwards. Sometimes they shimmer. Sometimes they just fall apart.

It's not trying to be a "do-everything" reverb. It does one thing. It does it weirdly.

## The Puck

Most reverb plugins have a ton of knobs that look like hardware from 50 years ago. This one has a puck. Slide it around.

**Left to right:** Body to Air. More presence or more wash. Your call.

**Down to up:** Near to Distant. Subtle or ghostly. Memories from recent or far back.

That's it. 

Advanced controls are in a drawer. Most people never open it.

The puck controls decay, modulation, ghost amount, and spatial depth. We're not sure how. But it works.

## Features

### Ghost Engine
It records you. Then plays you back. Detuned. Sometimes backwards. It's the main thing.

At high settings, memories play in reverse. It sounds surreal. We're not sure why you'd want that. But you can.

### Freeze
Locks the tail. Infinite sustain. The ghost engine freezes too. It replays the same moments over and over. With variation. Same material, different lenses.

Good for pads. Or drones. Or when you want to confuse yourself.

### Disintegration Loop
Press freeze twice. It records four bars. Then plays them back. Over and over.

But here's the thing: Each time it loops, it degrades. A little. Filters converge. Pitch drifts. The stereo tears apart. Like an old tape that's been played too many times.

Move the puck up: It falls apart faster. Move it down: It holds on longer. Move it left: Ghosts. Move it right: Fog.

Eventually it dissolves. Fades to nothing. Just like memories do.

Good for ambient beds. Or when you want something that doesn't stay the same. Or when you want to watch a moment slowly disappear.

### Ducking
Keeps reverb quiet when you play. Loud when you stop. Simple.

Essential for rhythm. Or when you don't want mud. Most people forget it exists.

### Drift
Modulation. Gentle. Persistent. Breaks up the static stuff.

The puck controls it. Left is stable. Right is seasick. We know which one you'll use.

### True Stereo
8×8 FDN. Real stereo. Not fake stereo. We're proud of this one.

It costs CPU. But it sounds good.

## Who It's For

Shoegaze guitarists. Ambient producers. Indie vocalists. People who like weird reverbs.

It's not for everyone. That's fine. We made it for us. You can use it too.

## Presets

Twelve of them. We named them after feelings. Not parameters. We think that's clever.

1. **unravel** — Default. Works on most things.
2. **fading polaroid** — Intimate. Close. Strong body.
3. **dissolving into mist** — Weightless. Maximum diffusion.
4. **rewind the moment** — Heavy ghost. Reverse playback. Weird.
5. **echoes you can't quite place** — Distant memories. Ethereal.
6. **held breath** — Freeze-ready. Long decay.
7. **sunfaded memory** — Soft. Warm. Nostalgic.
8. **shimmer and sway** — Modulated. Breathing. Evolving.
9. **between the notes** — Heavy ducking. Gaps only.
10. **weightless ascent** — Maximum distance. Hovering.
11. **twilight reversal** — Memories backwards. Surreal.
12. **whispering distance** — Vocals. Clear. Soft.

They're presets. Use them. Or don't. We don't care.

## Specs

VST3. AU. macOS. Windows.

Works at normal sample rates. Probably works at weird ones too. We didn't test everything.

CPU usage is reasonable. Unless you max everything. Then it's not.

---

## Philosophy

We wanted it to feel like a memory. Not a room or a tank or a spring.

Nostalgic. Bittersweet. Weightless. Soft.

That's the goal. We hit it sometimes. Sometimes we don't. That's fine.

It's not trying to do everything. It does one thing. We think it does it well.

### Feature Spotlight Section (For Blog/Update Post)

**Disintegration Loop: Memories That Fade**

Freeze was never enough. You could lock a moment. But it stayed the same. Frozen. Static.

Not anymore.

Press freeze twice. It records four bars of your reverb tail. Tempo-synced. Then it loops them. Over and over.

But here's what happens: Each pass through the loop degrades it. Just a little. The filters converge. Highs thin out. Lows fade. Pitch drifts downward. The stereo image tears apart. Like an old cassette tape that's been played too many times.

Move the puck up: It falls apart faster. In a few loops, it's gone.

Move it down: It holds on. Longer. Ten thousand loops later, it's still there. Barely.

Move it left: Ghost mode. Spectral thinning. Emphasize the highs. Like watching a photograph fade in the sun.

Move it right: Fog mode. Diffuse smearing. Preserve the mids. Like watching a memory blur in the rain.

Eventually it dissolves. Fades to nothing. Just like memories do. That's the point.

It's not a delay. It's not a looper. It's a memory that knows it won't last.

### Social Media Blurbs

**Short version (Twitter/X):**
Freeze is now a disintegration loop. Record 4 bars. Loop them. Watch them degrade. Each pass makes them weaker. Fainter. Until they fade to nothing. Just like memories.

Move the puck: Control how fast they fall apart. Or how long they hold on. We made it for ambient beds. You'll find other uses.

**Medium version (Instagram/Facebook):**
Disintegration Loop: The new way Freeze works.

Press freeze twice. It records four bars. Loops them. But each loop degrades them. Filters converge. Pitch drifts. Stereo tears apart. Like an old tape played too many times.

Move the puck up: Fast decay. Move it down: Endless loops. Move it left: Ghost mode. Move it right: Fog mode.

Eventually it dissolves. That's the point. Memories fade. So should your loops.

**Long version (Newsletter/Blog):**
We changed Freeze. It still locks the tail. But now it can do something else.

Press freeze twice. It records four bars of your reverb. Tempo-synced. Then it loops them. Over and over.

But each pass through the loop degrades it. A little. The filters converge. Highs thin. Lows fade. Pitch drifts. The stereo image tears apart. Like an old cassette that's been played too many times.

The puck controls it. Up is fast decay. Down is endless loops. Left is ghost mode (spectral thinning). Right is fog mode (diffuse smearing).

Eventually it dissolves. Fades to nothing. Just like memories do.

We made it for ambient beds. For drones. For moments that shouldn't stay the same.

It's not a delay. It's not a looper. It's a memory that knows it won't last.

### Product Page Update (Store Descriptions)

**New Feature Bullet:**
- Disintegration Loop: Record 4 bars of reverb tail, loop them, watch them degrade with each pass. Control decay speed and character with the puck. Eventually dissolves to nothing. Like memories do.

**Extended Feature Description:**
Freeze now includes Disintegration Loop mode. Press freeze twice to record four bars of your reverb tail (tempo-synced). The loop plays continuously, but each iteration degrades it: filters converge (HPF rises, LPF falls), pitch drifts downward, stereo channels decouple, tape-like dropouts appear. The puck controls the degradation rate (up = fast, down = endless) and character (left = ghost/spectral thinning, right = fog/diffuse smearing). Eventually the loop dissolves completely, fading to reverb only. Inspired by tape degradation and the concept of impermanent memories. Perfect for ambient beds, evolving drones, and moments that shouldn't stay static.

## Product Description (For Store Pages)

**Title:**
Threadbare – Unravel: A Reverb That Remembers

**Short Description:**
A reverb that records the last 750ms of your performance and plays it back as granular fragments. Sometimes backwards. Usually detuned. One puck controls everything. For people who like weird reverbs.

**Full Description:**
It's a reverb. Not a delay. We checked.

The Ghost Engine records the last 750 milliseconds of your performance. Then it plays it back as tiny grains. These grains feed into the reverb. The reverb remembers itself remembering you.

Control is one puck. Left to right: Body to Air. Down to up: Near to Distant. That's it. Advanced controls are in a drawer. Most people never open it.

Features:
- Ghost Engine with reverse playback and shimmer
- Freeze mode (locks the tail, freezes the ghost)
- Disintegration Loop (records 4 bars, loops them, degrades them with each pass)
- Ducking (keeps reverb quiet when you play)
- Drift modulation (stable to seasick)
- True stereo 8×8 FDN
- Twelve presets with pretentious names

It's not trying to do everything. It does one thing. We think it does it well.
